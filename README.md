## Judge Server
Unfortunately, the judge server is somehow isolated from judge website
for future convenience. Judge Server can be found at [eJudge](https://github.com/ultmaster/ejudge).
For more information about Judge Server, please read the `README` there, but note that the
`README` is also yet to be accomplished.
